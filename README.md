# Data-Showcase-Project
A showcase of my technical skills in a data-driven project. There is a ML model I developed that predicts if an NBA player is an all-star based on their statistical performance. This model used data from kaggle (usability rating: 5.6/10) and Basketball-reference. ML model was developed referencing the "Machine Learning A-Zâ„¢: Hands-On Python & R In Data Science" course I took on Udemy by Kirill Eremenko and Hadelin de Ponteves. Before the ML model, there are several data architecture/transformation steps I have included to showcase pandas and other python techniques that I use.
